\title{Translate power capacity to power generation}
\usage{
convert_power_cap_to_generation(
  data,
  capacity_factors_power = NULL,
  baseline_scenario,
  target_scenario
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame filtered and wrangled company level production
forecasts (of the companies in the portfolio). Usually based on PACTA
output.}

\item{capacity_factors_power}{A data frame containing capacity factors to
translate company level power capacity to units sold. Contains information
on the ald_business_unit (power sector only) and scenario_geography levels.}

\item{baseline_scenario}{String holding name of baseline scenario.}

\item{target_scenario}{String holding name of target scenario.}
}
\description{
Units of generated power are assumed to be sold and hence get priced in the
net profit calculations. This also entails converting MWh into MW per year,
since we calculate yearly profits. Note: For use in webscripts
\code{\link[=convert_cap_to_generation]{convert_cap_to_generation()}} is used currently, which only distinguishes
capacity factor by ald_business_unit and scenario_geography, whereas this function
distinguishes further by year and scenario. Also note that for generation of
variable \code{plan_tech_prod} (planned capacity) capacity factors from baseline
scenario are used.
