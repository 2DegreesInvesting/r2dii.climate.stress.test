\arguments{
\item{start_year}{Numeric. A numeric vector of length 1 that contains the
start year of the analysis.}

\item{end_year}{Numeric. A numeric vector of length 1 that contains the
end year of the analysis.}

\item{year_of_shock}{Numeric. A numeric vector of length 1 that contains the
year in which the policy shock first hits.}

\item{duration_of_shock}{Numeric. A numeric vector of length 1 that contains
the duration of the shock in years. I.e. the number of years it takes until
the trajectory of the company/sector reaches a new equilibrium pathway.}

\item{shock_strength}{Numeric. A numeric vector that contains the shock
size for the given company/ald_business_unit at hand, in case shock size is not
calculated endogenously by using the overshoot/carbon budget method.
TODO: (move to data argument)}

\item{scen_to_follow}{Numeric. A numeric vector that contains the production
trajectory of the scenario indicated to use as the target for the
company/ald_business_unit at hand.
TODO: (move to data argument)}

\item{planned_prod}{Numeric vector that includes the production plans for a
company or (aggregated) ald_business_unit to be included. The length of the vector
for each company is from the start year of the analysis to the end year of
the analysis, which means that in most cases, this vector will include NAs
after the final forecast year. This usually comes from a PACTA analysis.
TODO: (move to data argument)}

\item{late_sudden}{Numeric. A numeric vector that contains the
late & sudden production trajectory for the company/ald_business_unit at hand.
Before applying the shock, this follows the baseline scenario.
TODO: (move to data argument)}

\item{scenario_change}{Numeric. A numeric vector that contains the
absolute changes of the target scenario in yearly steps for the
company/ald_business_unit at hand.
TODO: (move to data argument)}

\item{scenario_change_baseline}{Numeric. A numeric vector that contains the
absolute changes of the baseline scenario in yearly steps for the
company/ald_business_unit at hand.
TODO: (move to data argument)}

\item{scenario_change_aligned}{Numeric. A numeric vector that contains the
absolute changes of the aligned target scenario in yearly steps for the
company/ald_business_unit at hand, in case the company/ald_business_unit is aligned
with the target after the forecast period.
TODO: (move to data argument)}

\item{overshoot_direction}{Character. A character vector that indicates if
the ald_business_unit at hand is increasing or decreasing over the time frame of
the analysis.
TODO: (move to data argument)}

\item{time_frame}{Numeric. A vector of length 1 indicating the number of years
for which forward looking production data is considered.}

\description{
Prior to the shock, this will keep the
trajectory untouched, i.e., the trajectory follows baseline up until the
shock. After the shock hits, the development depends on whether or not
the company/ald_business_unit is already aligned and on what type of calculation
is selected for the shock. Overall the outcome should lead the
company/ald_business_unit to stay within the bounds of the carbon budget, if the
method applied is the overshoot/carbon budget method.
