</h2>
<p>This vignette gives a brief overview of the files that are generated by the climate transition risk stress test provided in <code>r2dii.climate.stress.test</code> and proceeds to explain in depth how to read the data in each of the files.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="overview">Overview<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are eight output files that the user can expect when running the stress test for a given set of parameters.</p>
<p>They can loosely be grouped in files that contain estimates of the market risk of companies in the portfolio and of the credit risk of said companies in a corporate loan book. Depending on the use case, one or the other may contain more relevant information. In addition, a log file is written to the results directory. It holds an overview on holdings that could not be considered in the analysis.</p>

<p>In this section, we look at the output files and what each of the variables they contain mean.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="shared-outputs-model-parameters">Shared Outputs: Model Parameters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#shared-outputs-model-parameters"></a>
</h4>
<p>All result files discussed below contain information on the settings of the stress testing model. This means each one of them contains information on all model input variables, <a href="https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.climate.stress.test/articles/articles/03-run-stress-test.html#understanding-the-input-arguments">as described here</a>.</p>
<p>While there is some redundancy to this information, it is the easiest way to ensure the results remain reproducible and a straight forward way for the user to understand given magnitudes in the model results. In the standard case this implies that the argument columns each just contain one value.</p>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="sensitivity-analyses">Sensitivity Analyses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sensitivity-analyses"></a>
</h5>
<p>Running a sensitivity analysis produces as many sets of results as parameter values are passed to the variable the analysis is iterated over. To make the ensuing analysis easy and avoid clutter in the output directory, analysis outputs will use the name of the variable that is varied as the suffix and simply contain the results of multiple runs in one file. The variation can be seen by looking at the argument column of the variable that was iterated over. Instead of just one value, it will contain values for every iteration of the sensitivity analysis.</p>
