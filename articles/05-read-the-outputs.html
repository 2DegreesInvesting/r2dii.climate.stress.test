<p>This vignette gives a brief overview of the files that are generated by the climate transition risk stress test provided in <code>r2dii.climate.stress.test</code> and proceeds to explain in depth how to read the data in each of the files.</p>

<p>The source code generates nine result (output) files after completing the transition risk stress test for a given set of parameters. They principally contain estimates of the market risk of companies in the portfolio and of the credit risk of said companies in a corporate loan book. The source code additionally outputs a file with company-level cash-flow trajectories and a log file which holds information on the settings of the current transition risk stress test run.</p>
<p>If the user follows the recommended data folder structure the output files will be found here:</p>
<ul>

<li>
<code>expected_loss_shock</code>: The expected loss of the holdings of a company in the analyzed portfolio or loan book based on the exposure to that company under a shock scenario (here: a late and sudden climate transition policy).

</h4>
<p>All result files discussed below contain the values of the input parameters in the stress testing model. The information on all model input parameters <a href="https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.climate.stress.test/articles/articles/03-run-stress-test.html#understanding-the-input-arguments">is described here</a>. The result files contain the following set of input parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>asset_type_arg</code> is the type of the analysed financial asset in the portfolio.</li>
<li>
<code>lgd_senior_claims_arg</code> is the loss given default used in the expected loss calculation of loans for senior claims (notably for corporate loans, so this is a potentially important parameter in this calculation)</li>
<li>
<code>lgd_subordinated_claims_arg</code> is the loss given default used in the expected loss calculation of loans for subordinated claims (notably for corporate bonds. Not of relevance in the loans calculation)</li>
<li>
<code>risk_free_rate_arg</code> the risk free interest rate. Input parameter to the Merton credit risk model.</li>
<li>
<code>discount_rate_arg</code> the annual rate at which future cash flows are discounted when calculating the net present value of companies in the loan book. Since the net present values are indirect inputs into the Merton credit risk model, this parameter my be relevant.</li>
<li>
<code>div_netprofit_prop_coef_arg</code> Coefficient that indicates what share of the net present value should be considered to derive the equity value of a company.</li>
<li>
<code>shock_year_arg</code> year in which the policy is introduced, that adjusts the production values of companies to stay in line with carbon budgets.</li>
<li>
<code>fallback_term_arg</code> indicates which maturity the loans in the loan book are assumed to have. At this point we assume these are rolled over every year.</li>
<li>
<code>scenario_geography_arg</code> Indicates which geographical region(s) (concerning asset location) results shall be calculated for.</li>
<li>
<code>use_company_terms_arg</code> Logical parameter, indicating if individually provided terms for companies as configured in company_terms.csv shall be used instead of fallback as provided in <code>fallback_term</code>. The default is FALSE. For more details compare <a href="https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.climate.stress.test/articles/articles/04-advanced-data-settings.html">Advanced data settings</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there may be some redundancy to this information, it is there to ensure the results remain reproducible and straightforward for the user to understand given magnitudes in the model results. In the standard run of the stress test, with a single value specified for each input parameter, this implies that the argument columns just contain one value each (as opposed to sensitivity analysis where the user can set multiples values of input parameters).</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="sensitivity-analyses">Sensitivity Analyses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sensitivity-analyses"></a>
</h4>
<p>Running a sensitivity analysis produces as many sets of results as the number of input parameters selected for the variable of interest.To keep the ensuing analysis as simple as possible, the results files are named with a suffix indicating the parameter that was varied in the particular run and saved in a new output folder. Apart from the indicative naming suffix the sensitivity analysis results files produced have the same format as described above but contain the results of multiple runs in a single file.</p>
<p>The variation is observed in the argument column of the parameter that was iterated over. Instead of just one value, it will contain values for every iteration of the sensitivity analysis, be it two or more.</p>
