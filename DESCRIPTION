Description: The package provides functions and workflows for conducting financial
  stress tests of listed equity, corporate bond and corporate loan portfolios.
  It specifically focuses on climate change related risks, such as
  transition/policy risk, litigation risk and physical risk. The methodologies
  develpoped by 2DII focus on forward looking approaches and asset based analyses
  where possible. Some external stress tests are also featured.
  This package is currently in the beta stage and not finalised yet. Changes to
  the methodology will still be made that can and will impact the outcomes of
  the analysis.
