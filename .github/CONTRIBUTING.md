As a developer you'll need to set two enviornmental variables (e.g.
in .Renviron):

```
# Where to save project agnostic files?
# For example, see 2DII's Dropbox at
# PortCheck/00_Data/07_AnalysisInputs/ST_INPUTS_MASTER
ST_DATA_PATH=/a/path

# Where to save project specific inputs and outputs?
# For example, for bonds (fastest) see 2DII's Dropbox at 
# PortCheck_v2/10_Projects/ST_TESTING_BONDS
ST_PROJECT_FOLDER_INPUT=/another/path/inputs
ST_PROJECT_FOLDER_OUTPUT=/another/path/outputs
```
