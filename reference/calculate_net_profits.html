baseline and late and sudden scenarios. Climate laggards which need to build
out their production in increasing technologies to compensate for their
missed targets, are "punished" by adjusting the net profit margin on their
additional build out based on their proximity to target within the given
technology. Specifically, we measure the ratio of how much of the required
build out or reduction in a technology the company will have done at the end
of the forecast period. If the technology has an increasing target and the
ratio of completion is below one, the net_profit_margin on the additional
production build out is multiplied with the proximity to the target. This
approximates the additional capital investment such a company would have to
make in a short time, which leads to added costs. This ensures that late
build out will not proportionally translate into increased profits. — calculate_net_profits • r2dii.climate.stress.test</title><!-- jquery --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-CSXorXvZcTkaix6Yvo6HppcZGetbYMGWSFlBw8HfCJo=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- Bootstrap --><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha256-bZLfwXAP04zRMK2BjiO8iu9pf4FbLqX6zitd+tIvLhE=" crossorigin="anonymous"><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha256-nuL8/2cJ5NDSSwnKD8VqreErSWHtnEP9E7AySL+1ev4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- bootstrap-toc --><link rel="stylesheet" href="../bootstrap-toc.css"><script src="../bootstrap-toc.js"></script><!-- Font Awesome icons --><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.12.1/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha256-mmgLkCYLUQbXn0B1SRqzHar6dCnv9oZFPEC1g1cwlkk=" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.12.1/css/v4-shims.min.css" integrity="sha256-wZjR52fzng1pJHwx4aV2AO3yyTOXrcDW7jBpJtTwVxw=" crossorigin="anonymous"><!-- clipboard.js --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/clipboard.js/2.0.6/clipboard.min.js" integrity="sha256-inc5kl9MA1hkeYUt+EC3BhlIgyp/2jDIyBLS6k3UxPI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- headroom.js --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/headroom/0.11.0/headroom.min.js" integrity="sha256-AsUX4SJE1+yuDu5+mAVzJbuYNPHj/WroHuZ8Ir/CkE0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/headroom/0.11.0/jQuery.headroom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZX/yNShbjqsohH1k95liqY9Gd8uOiE1S4vZc+9KQ1K4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- pkgdown --><link href="../pkgdown.css" rel="stylesheet"><script src="../pkgdown.js"></script><meta property="og:title" content="Calculates annual net profits on the company-technology level for the
