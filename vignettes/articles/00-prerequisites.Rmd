## Prerequisites

This vignette describes the necessary prerequisites for installing `r2dii.climate.stress.test` and performing the stress testing analysis.

## Hardware requirements

* Operating system: Linux, Mac, Unix, or Windows. Must be 64-bit.
* RAM: 8GB or more.
* Hard Drive Space: 5GB or more.

## Software Requirements

2DII climate transition stress testing analysis is performed using R packages. R is a programming language in which the source code is written. To use R, it is easiest to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), in this case RStudio. It is recommended for the person performing the analysis to have basic coding skills.

Programming language:

R - version must be 3.4 or higher (it is best practice to download the most recent version of R). This can be downloaded for Windows from https://cran.studio.com/bin/windows/base

In most cases, this will be downloadable from the bank's internal software repository server subject to approval by the bank's IT department.

Integrated Development Environment (IDE):

RStudio - This can be downloaded at https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

Again, in most cases this will be downloadable from the bank's internal system, subject to approval.

## PACTA for Banks

PACTA for Banks enables banks to measure the alignment of their corporate lending portfolios with climate scenarios across a set of key climate-relevant sectors and technologies. The climate transition risk stress test builds on company level forward looking production data for NFCs in order to account for adaptive capacity. 

The development version or the climate transition stress test requires that the user has successfully run at least the matching part of PACTA for Banks to produce the relevant project-specific raw input files.
