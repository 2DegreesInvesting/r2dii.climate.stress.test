This vignette describes the necessary prerequisites for installing `r2dii.climate.stress.test` and performing the stress testing analysis.

## Hardware requirements

* Operating system: Linux, Mac, Unix, or Windows. Must be 64-bit.
* RAM: 8GB or more.
* Hard Drive Space: 5GB or more.

## Software Requirements

The 2DII 1in1000 stress test is performed using the 1in1000 model suite writting in R code and distributed as an R package.
R is a programming language in which the source code is written. 
To use R, it is easiest to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE),
in this case RStudio. It is recommended for the person performing the analysis 
to have basic coding skills.

**Programming language**

* R - version must be 3.4 or higher (it is best practice to download the most 
recent version of R). This can be downloaded for Windows from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
* In most cases, this should be downloadable from the financial institution's
software repository but may be subject to internal approval

**Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**

* RStudio - This can be downloaded at https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
* Again, this should be downloadable from the financial institution's software 
repository but may be subject to internal approval

## PACTA for Banks

PACTA for Banks enables banks to measure the alignment of their corporate 
lending portfolios with climate scenarios across a set of key climate-relevant 
sectors and technologies. The climate transition risk stress test uses 
prewrangled climate scenario data from PACTA.

## Asset Resolution
The 1in1000 model suite uses forward looking asset-level production data 
in order to account for adaptive capacity. The respective data are provided by Asset Resolution.
