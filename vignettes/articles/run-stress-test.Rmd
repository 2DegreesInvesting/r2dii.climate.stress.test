This vignette describes in detail, how to run a climate transition risk stress
test for loans, using the function `run_stress_test` to calculate the credit risk
of a loan book.

## Assumptions

In order to keep this vignette concise, we assume the following has been set up:

1. R and RStudio are installed
2. All required R packages are installed, this specifically includes
`r2dii.data`, `r2dii.match`, `r2dii.analysis` and `r2dii.climate.stress.test`
1. The user has obtained all relevant input files as described in the pdf manual
1. The input files are organized in a folder structure consistent with the manual
1. This notably implies the user has successfully run at least the matching
part of PACTA for banks to produce the relevant project-specific input files
1. The user has set up objects that point to the input directories for
project-specific and project-agnostic input files.
1. The user has successfully run the function `run_prep_calculation_loans()` to
generate the input files Â´for the main stress test function in the required
format. Refer to the vignette **LINK** for details on how to do this.

## Running the Analysis

The climate transition risk stress test can be run for a single set of parameters
or as a sensitivity analysis for a set of parameters that iterates over one of
the input arguments. We will look at both cases.

Use `library()` to attach the package

```{r setup}
library(r2dii.climate.stress.test)
```

## Running the Stress Test for one scenario

In order to run a stress test for loans on one set of parameters, the user needs
to pass exactly one value per input argument to the function
`run_prep_calculation_loans()`. The only argument that does not have a default
value and is absolutely required to be set by the user is `asset_type`. In our
case, we want to run the stress test for loans, so the easiest way to obtain
results is by running:

```{r}
run_stress_test("loans")
```

This will calculate the stress test for loans and write the results into the
designated output directory, using the default values for all detail arguments.

The user may change any detail argument by explicitly passing it to the function.
Note that there are allowed ranges for each of the inputs as described in the
README.

The detail arguments are the following (defaults in brackets):

* lgd_senior_claims (0.45)
* lgd_subordinated_claims (0.75)
* terminal_value (0)
* risk_free_rate (0.02)
* discount_rate (0.02)
* div_netprofit_prop_coef (1)
* shock_year (2030)
* term (2)
* company_exclusion (TRUE)

The meaning of each of the detail arguments is as follows:

* `lgd_senior_claims` is the loss given default used in the expected loss
calculation of loans for senior claims (notably for corporate loans, so this is
a potentially important parameter in this calculation)
* `lgd_subordinated_claims` is the loss given default used in the expected loss
calculation of loans for subordinated claims (notably for corporate bonds. Not
of relevance in the loans calculation)
* `terminal_value` the percentage of the net present value that should be used
to approximate further cash flows beyond the timeframe of the model.
* `risk_free_rate` the risk free interest rate. Input parameter to the Merton
credit risk model.
* `discount_rate` the annual rate at which future cash flows are discounted when
calculating the net present value of companies in the loan book. Since the net
present values are indirect inputs into the Merton credit risk model, this
paramter my be relevant.
* `div_netprofit_prop_coef` Coefficient that indicates what share of the net
present value should be considered to derive the equity value of a company.
* `shock_year` year in which the policy is introduced, that adjusts the
production values of companies to stay in line with carbon budgets.
* `term` indicates which maturity the loans in the loan book are assumed to have.
At this point we assume these are rolled over every year.
* `company_exclusion` Logical paramter that indicates if certain combonations of
company and technology should be excluded from the analysis. At this point, it
is stringly recommended to set this ti TRUE (default) because there is not yet a
dedicated mechanism in place that handles companies which are phasing out
certain technologies within the time frame of the production forecast.

This means that the user may want to run a stress test that is tailored to their
assumptions of a plausible shock scenario. For example, the user could decide to
set a lower `risk_free_rate` and shock the companies earlier than by default,
using:

```{r}
run_stress_test("loans", risk_free_rate = 0.01, shock_year = 2028)
```

The output files are automatically written to the `outputs` sub directory of the
project folder and are named:

* `stress_test_results_loans_port_standard.csv`
* `stress_test_results_loans_comp_standard.csv`
* `stress_test_results_loans_comp_el_standard.csv`
* `stress_test_results_loans_sector_pd_changes_annual_standard.csv`
* `stress_test_results_loans_sector_pd_changes_overall_standard.csv`

## Running a Sensitivity Analysis for the Stress Test

In case the user wants to understand the sensitivities of the model to the input
parameters mentioned above, it is straight forward to run a sensitivity analysis
that does exactly that.

In order to do that, one simply passes a vector of allowed values for one (and
only one) of the detail arguments when running the stress test function. This
will lead to the model iterating over the set of values passed for the chosen
argument, while keeping all other input arguments constant.

**NOTE:** It is not possible to iterate over `asset_type`.

If the user wishes to understand the impact of the `shock_year` on the results
for example, they can run the following:

```{r}
run_stress_test("loans", shock_year = c(2025, 2028, 2032, 2035))
```

This will yield outputs with four versions of the stress test, one for each of
the shock years indicated. All the results will be written into one file per
output type for ease of use, e.g.:

* `stress_test_results_loans_port_shock_year.csv`
* `stress_test_results_loans_comp_shock_year.csv`
* `stress_test_results_loans_comp_el_shock_year.csv`
* `stress_test_results_loans_sector_pd_changes_annual_shock_year.csv`
* `stress_test_results_loans_sector_pd_changes_overall_shock_year.csv`


The user can still alternate the default parameters of other input arguments,
when iterating over the `shock_year`, e.g. if the risk_free_rate should be
lower than the default, the following will work:

```{r}
run_stress_test("loans", risk_free_rate = 0.01, shock_year = c(2025, 2028, 2032, 2035))
```

Note that the selected detail arguments will be written to the result files so
that it is always easy to understand which parameters were used in a given
calculation.
