Beta version. More soonâ€¦

The goal of r2dii.climate.stress.test is to provide a tool that can be used to conduct what-if climate stress test analyses for financial institutions, supervisors, regulators and other stakeholders. The tool aims at highlighting potential financial risk in especially climate relevant sectors, split by production technology where required. The sectors covered by the 2Dii climate stress test and therefore by this package, follow mostly the logic of the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) tool, but can in principle be adapted to other settings.
W.I.P.

## Installation

You can install development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.climate.stress.test")
```

## Scope

The repository covers climate risk calculations for the following types of risks

- Transition Risk
- Litigation Risk
It will be extended to also cover
- Physical Risk

The methods for all of these are currently in the development phase, meaning there are likely going to be changes to the calculations in future releases.

The following financial asset types are currently covered:

- Listed Equity (EQ)
- Corporate Bonds (CB)
- Corporate Loans (LBK)

Other asset types may be covered in the future.


## Work flows

The repository is structured in a way that provides dedicated work flows for each of the risk types and some of the asset types.

### Transition Risk for listed equity and corporate bonds

...

### Transition Risk for corporate loan books

#### Methodological notes

Calculating the transition risk for corporate loan book related to a sudden
policy shock differs from the calculation of such a shock for listed equity.
The value change of loans is not captured well simply by applying a DCF model.
Dedicated credit risk models are required instead. Specifically, we want to
quantify the impact of a climate transition shock on the probabilities of
default (PD) of the loans at hand. This is a common risk metric for loans and
a change in PDs is therefore expected to be of more use to anyone applying this
software, then a shock based on changes in market value of the issuing company.
The PD can then be used to derive impacts on the value of a loan book, by
plugging the changed PD into an expected loss (EL) calculation, which is in its
fundamental form defined as:

EL = PD * LGD * EAD

... with LGD being the loss given default (percentage loss) and EAD the exposure
at default (value of the loan in absolute currency in the loan book at hand).

In our case, we aim at using a structural model. Data constraints are a limiting
factor with regard to using company level information that would normally go
into a case by case rating of credit worthiness. Hence, we use the Merton model,
which requires as inputs the asset value in t = 0 (A_0) and the debt value (D)
of the company at hand. The debt value is assumed constant over time, the asset
value in t = 0 is derived as A_0 = E_0 (equity value in t = 0) * D.
We further need the volatility of the equity value, the risk free rate and the
term structure as inputs.

The outcome of the Merton model is a PD contignent to the inputs. For us, the
value of interest is not an absolute PD as a direct outcome of the model, but
rather how the PD changes between a baseline scenario and a late and sudden
scenario. We therefore keep all inputs equal except the valuations under those
two scenarios. We model a PD under the baseline scenario and another under a
late and sudden scenario and calculate the relative change for the given set of
parameters. This will result in a change in PDs that does not reflect the
magnitude of the equity and debt values and can therefore be applied as a shock
factor on PDs that banks may have calculated with a different model themselves:

PD_change = (PD_late_sudden - PD_baseline) / PD_baseline


##### Assumptions

- For E_0, we use the discounted values derived from the DCF model we use to
calculate changes in market value. This builds on the capex plans of the
companies in the calculation of the future profits that are used in the DCF
model. We therefore get different company values for the business as usual and
the late and sudden cases, which we can use to differentiate the scenarios in
the credit risk calculation.
- For D, we currently use sectoral equity-debt ratios and thus derive the value
from the equity value of the business as usual scenario. The current values in
use are mock values for test purposes that need to be replaced with empirical
values. This may become a user input option in the future. **OPEN**
- For volatility, we currently use a fixed value of 0.2. The current value in
use is a mock value for test purposes that needs to be replaced with empirical
values. This may become a user input option in the future. **OPEN**
- The risk free rate is currently set at 0.05. The current value in
use is a mock value for test purposes that needs to be replaced with empirical
values. This may become a user input option in the future. **OPEN**
- The PD changes are calculated for all maturities (in full years) between the
year of the shock and the end year of the analysis. This allows the user to
understand the sensitivity of the impact to the term structure, but is also
required to adequately capture loans of different maturities to the same company.
It remains to be confirmed that this is the appropriate way to cover the
different maturities or if other considerations need to be reflected.
- On a technical level, we use implementation of the Merton model from the
CreditRisk R package, which is described in more detail here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CreditRisk/CreditRisk.pdf


#### Prerequisites

In order to calculate the impacts from transition risk on a corporate loan book,
the user needs to provide as input:

- Parameter settings to locate the project in st_project_settings.yml
- Model parameters to use in the financial valuation and to select scenarios in
model_parameters.yml
- PACTA for banks output at the company level, enriched with company level loan
shares. This can be created by following the steps in the script calc_loan_book.R
in this repository. For more information on how to use PACTA for banks,
consult: https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.match/ and
https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.analysis/index.html
- Sector exposures to the relevant sectors of the analysis. This can be obtained
by following the steps in the script calc_loan_book.R in this repository.
- Specifications of transition scenarios for which to calculate shocks and
impacts on the given portfolio. These are provided via a file,
transition_scenario_input.csv
- Capacity factors for the power sector, to transform power capacity into power
production, using the file capacity_factors_WEO_2017.csv. This is required in
order to calculate profits on actual quantities produced, not theoretical
capacities.
- Scenario data that covers production road maps for all technologies that are
to be analysed up until 2040. The scenario data need to cover those road maps
for the scenarios selected in the parameter files and should follow the
structure found in Scenarios_AnalysisInput_YYYY.csv. This data is used to
extrapolate the production trajectories for companies beyond the PACTA time frame.
- Price data trajectories found in the file prices_data_YYYYQQ.csv, which
contains projections of market prices per technology from the start data of the
analysis until the year 2040. This is another required input to obtain profits.
- Net profit margins are loaded via the model_parameters.yml file up until now.
This may change in the future.
- It is of particular importance that the start year of the analysis is available
in the PACTA results, in the scenario data and in the price data. If either data
set starts after the start year of the analysis, the work flow will not work.
- Equally, the scenarios selected for the analysis must be given in the PACTA
results as well as in the scenario data and the price data.

#### Steps

- Initialize project
- Load project parameters
- Load all project input data
- Wrangle input data
- Initialise empty results object
- Loop over transition scenarios (as defined in transition_scenarios_input.csv),
calculating and row-binding results to the results object. Calculation entails:
  - plucking a specific scenario definition from the transition scenarios to obtain model inputs (1)
  - calculating the corresponding price trajectories (2)
  - calculating the corresponding production trajectories on the company level (3)
  - joining the price trajectories to the production trajectories (3)
  - joining net profit margins to the production and price trajectories (3)
  - calculating future net profits for the entire analysis time frame (3)
  - calculate discounted net profits for the entire analysis time frame, using the DCF model (3)
  - plucking the portfolio share (plan_carsten) of each company from the pacta data input (4)
  - calculating value changes and percentage losses per transition scenario, by combining company level DCF output with portfolio share of the corresponding holdings (6)
  - Calculate PD changes per company-technology and maturity (7)
  - aggreagate PD changes to the loan book level to derive expected losses (7)
- write company-tech level results to initialized project folder
- write portfolio-tech level results to initialized project folder
