The goal of r2dii.climate.stress.test is to provide a tool that can be used to conduct what-if climate stress test analyses for financial institutions, supervisors, regulators and other stakeholders. The tool aims at highlighting potential financial risk in especially climate relevant sectors, split by production technology where required. The sectors covered by the 2Dii climate stress test and therefore by this package, follow mostly the logic of the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) tool, but can in principle be adapted to other settings. Application of the code requires availability of custom data. In order to participate in a climate stress testing project with 2 degrees investing initiative please contact jacob@2degrees-investing.org.

## Installation

Install the development version of r2dii.climate.stress.test from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.climate.stress.test")
```

## Example
* Use `library()` to attach the package
```{r}
library(r2dii.climate.stress.test)
```

* Run climate stress tests
```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## run stress testing for assets of type corporate loans using default parameters
run_stress_test(asset_type = "loans")

## run stress testing for asset of type corporate bond using various risk_free_rates to analyse sensitivities
run_stress_test(asset_type = "loans", risk_free_rate = c(0.01, 0.03))
```

## Details
### Prepare input data
Stress tests for corporate loans require an additional step for input data preparation for initial application of stress testing on a loanbook.
```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
run_prep_calculation_loans()

```

### Look up valid ranges of model parameters
You can look up allowed values of model parameters as such:
```{r}
# looking up allowed range for risk_free_rate
risk_free_rate_range_lookup

# looking up allowed values for credit_type
credit_type_lookup

```
