The goal of r2dii.climate.stress.test is to provide a tool that can be used to
conduct what-if climate stress test analyses for financial institutions,
supervisors, regulators and other stakeholders. The tool aims at highlighting
potential financial risk in especially climate relevant sectors, split by
production technology where required. The sectors covered by the 2DII climate
stress test and therefore by this package, follow mostly the logic of the Paris
Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) tool, but can in principle be
adapted to other settings. Application of the code requires availability of
custom data. For more information about the methodology and inquiries on running
a pilot of the stress test in cooperation with 2DII, please contact
<jacob@2degrees-investing.org>.

## Details

To run the analysis...

* the prerequisites must be fulfilled,
* the package must be installed,
* the project directories must be set up,
* input data must be prepared and
* the detailed options available for running the functions ought to be understood.

Detailed information for all these steps and on interpreting the outcomes can be
found in the articles linked below.
